Today I've been thinking about the value of building in public. There's something powerful about sharing the journey, not just the destination.

It creates accountability, attracts like-minded people, and helps others learn from both successes and mistakes.

In the Bitcoin space especially, transparency is a core value. Why should building be any different?
