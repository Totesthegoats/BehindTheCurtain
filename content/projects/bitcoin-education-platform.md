## Project Overview

This platform was built to address the gap in accessible Bitcoin education. Too many resources are either too technical or too superficial.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on exercises that teach by doing
- **Wallet Simulation**: Practice with Bitcoin without risking real funds
- **Progress Tracking**: See your learning journey

## Impact

Helping newcomers understand Bitcoin in a practical, hands-on way has been incredibly rewarding. The community feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.
